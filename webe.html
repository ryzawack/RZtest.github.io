        <br>
        <br>WEBE is an app that allows one awesome* group to connect with other
        <br>awesome groups spontaneously, and in real-time. There is no planning ahead necessary.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>*If you think you're group is awesome it is.</p>
      <p class="prtfolio-p"><strong class="projectstep">Story</strong>
        <br>
        <br>WEBE is an app I attempted to create. Without experience in app design or coding, everything done had to be learned on the fly.
        <br>
        <br>The app unfortunately didn’t make it to the app store. For this reason I have turned it into a case study. Some of the work I did fell into the User Experience realm, and it is really where my love for UX&nbsp;began.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>The approach I took with WEBE was very much a “lean” startup model of build, measure, and learn. The urgency to create was so high that I would build based on assumptions rather than research, then test it, learn from it, and then iterate using the new knowledge.
        <br>
        <br> With this style, the empathize and understand step was trumped by ideation.</p>

        <br>
        <br>WeBe is a mobile app that allows your friends to meet new friends so you can all be friends.
        <br>
        <br>Unlike dating sites, we are not creating dates and this is a group setting.
        <br>
        <br>Unlike most meet-up sites, we are spontaneous, no planning necessary.
        <br>
        <br>WeBe uses mobile technology to bring people together who should be together, so they can all have a great time.</p>
      <p class="prtfolio-p"><strong class="projectstep">Why Webe</strong>
        <br>
        <br>You hear it from Mom, Dad, friends, children, rap artists, teachers, pretty much everyone and anyone; you’ve even heard it from yourself… “you only live once.” A set of four words meant to inspire and get you in motion. Well here’s my problem; I get in motion, and I haven’t a clue what to do once I'm moving.
        <br>
        <br> For the much of my “adult” life, “YOLO” was followed by a shot of hard liquor, an acceptance for bottle service, or an action of me getting off my couch to go out when I really wanted to just watch Netflix… maybe all three in the same night.
        <br>
        <br> For others the threat of only living once may inspire them to travel the world, or get married and start a family, or simply live every weekend like “it’s their last.” However, whatever it is that we chose to make us feel like we are living, there is always one key component there with us. Always. That component is people.
        <br>
        <br> People are the real wonder of the world, and with that being said, human interaction is it’s treasure. I mean, the Eiffel Tower isn’t a romantic landmark without the the people who were romantic there. Keep this in mind.
        <br>
        <br> So if you think about people being the key to living life, why do we continuously chose to be scared of meeting others? Or is it laziness? Stubbornness? Maybe convenience? Is it just too hard to make plans with people outside of your usual crew?
        <br>
        <br> Well let me tell you a story.
        <br>
        <br> One late summer night when I lived in Chicago, I was walking home by myself. A man was walking pretty close behind me. I got a weird feeling and my heart-rate started to pick up.
        <br>
        <br> I was also trailed by a this silver Mercedes blasting some baby-making music.
        <br>
        <br> The Music got louder as the Mercedes got closer, so did the man. “Looove them and leave them…. That’s what I used to do.” I finally turned to look. It was this old man. He said “Oooo brother, this is a jam!” not caring one bit that I was there. “Then I laid eyes on you, it was paaiinn before pleasure.”
        <br>
        <br> Both of us, the Mercedes, and the smooth R&amp;B were then caught by a red light. Screw it, I’ll start up a conversation. I said “man, this is some smooth stuff.” I felt embarrassed asking because he knew every word, but I had to find out. “What’s the name of this song?” “Oh man, Fire and Desire” he said, “Used to love this back in my heyday.” I could tell. “Just wait until Teena Marie comes in, boy it’s hot.”
        <br>
        <br>The light turns green and the Mercedes speeds off along with Rick James, and Teena Marie. It’s just myself and the pretty-good-singing-old-timer now. He turns to me and says “man, you know if a cop comes by here, he’s going to think I’m selling you drugs.” I said, “yeah, but I know you’re really just giving me a music lesson.” We laughed, gave a hand shake, and went our separate ways.
        <br>
        <br> I had spent about 3 hours at my friend’s house that night. The same 8 or 10 or 15 of us that always hang out together were there. I don’t remember one conversation we had. However, I don’t think I’ll forget that minute on my walk back home when I heard that old man sing, spoke music with him, and saw him smile. Not to mention, Fire and Desire IS A JAM.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> There is something about having a connection with someone you've never meet before that makes you feel like you’re living. It’s something powerful.
        <br>
        <br> People are not all the same. We all know this, and that is the beauty. When somebody says something you don’t agree with, when you hear a perspective you’ve never thought about before, when commonality breads a connection with somebody you’ve never met, when a group of people laugh at the same joke… is that’s what being alive is? Maybe that’s the remedy to the threat of only living once.
        <br>
        <br> To bring it back, I’ve struggled for what I really wanted to do with my one life. When I’m inspired, where can I channel that energy? Better yet, what can make me feel that energy… feel alive? The answer is you. And WEBE believes your answer lies with me… and him, and her, and them too. You are born you, but make no mistake, you don’t find who you really are without the people you’ve encountered throughout your life. Don’t stop now. Keep living, keep learning about yourself and about others, keep growing as a person… by meeting new people. WEBE will make sure that always happens.
        <br>
        <br> Now, there was a time when people HAD to approach others in person in order to speak to them. There wasn't any other way to meet people. You couldn't ride a train, watch your love-at-first-sight leave one stop short of yours, go on “Happn", and attempt to locate them so that you can tell them through your cell phone what you couldn't say in person.
        <br>
        <br> There was a time you didn't share your opinions behind the comfort of your laptop in a box called “status”. You spoke, OUT LOUD, the words on your mind. WEBE gets it though, times are changing, but humans didn't come equipped with voices for nothing. It’s time to look up from that phone for a while and bring back social interaction; the catch-22 is technology can be used to make that much easier. WEBE wants you to use your phone to get off your phone. Use WEBE, be alive, create memorable experiences instead of doing the same thing with the same people all the time. And, oh, don’t worry if you’re shy, your friends will be right by your side the whole time.
        <br>
        <br> Times change.
        <br>
        <br> Memories are forever.</p>
      <p class="prtfolio-p"><strong class="projectstep">What is Webe - User Story</strong>
        <br>
        <br>When friends, coworkers, couples, or any group of people want to go out, but would like to enjoy the company of some new faces, WEBE enables them to do that. WEBE is a mobile application that spurs spontaneous group meet up.
        <br>
        <br> For example, Timmy, Jimmy, and Johnny are good friends that hang out all the time. They are a little tired of going to the same places and seeing the same friends they’ve had since high school every weekend. Sparking up conversations out at bars is not very successful for them. They just don’t know how to meet a new group of people to hang out with for a night out around town, especially in the dead of Chicago winter.
        <br>
        <br> Timmy tells the crew that a new app WEBE has just launched in Chicago. “It’s supposed to let us see other groups of people that are going out around us,” he says, so they all download the WEBE to see what the rage is all about.
        <br>&nbsp;
        <br> When they open it up, they can see pictures of WEBEs (groups) around the town (within in a range that they choose). Not only can they view pictures of WEBEs (which are taken of the WEBEs in real-time as a “groupie”), but Timmy, Jimmy, and Johnny can see each WEBE’s 1) Name, 2) Motto, 3) Plan, 4) State of mind (i.e. chill or partying hard), and 5) who is in the group. They scroll through and find at least five WEBEs that they would like to hang out with that night.
        <br>
        <br> Since WEBE won’t let them “like” a WEBE without having one of their own, that’s their next step. Time to step up their game!
        <br>&nbsp;
        <br> To begin, Timmy creates the WEBE and adds them with a quick search. Since Jimmy and Johnny are close by (in the same room in this instance), WEBE allows them to be added to the group. This keeps the integrity of each WEBE.
        <br>
        <br> Next, they need come up with a name. Johnny says “The Players”! Timmy is more of girlfriend-type guy and doesn’t want to be a “player” so he shoots it down. Of course Timmy gets made fun of for being a softy, but he doesn’t care. Jimmy counters with “how about the ‘Thermal-Boys’ and the motto could be ‘we’ll warm you up’.” Jimmy takes some heat for the idea, but they all actually like it. They bat around a few more ideas which has already brightened the mood, but ultimately decide on the Thermal-Boys.
        <br>
        <br> Name and motto are set, but what’s their plan for the night and what’s their mind-set? Quite frankly, they are up for anything. It’s been a long winter of River North bars and lots of wasted money on “shots for everyone!” They could care less what they do, as long as it’s with some fun people, so they leave it blank. The mind-set. Well, they don’t want to be super hungover tomorrow, but they also want to let loose and catch a good buzz. One a scale of 1-5 they want to turn it up to about a 3 (scale is the same on WEBE). A “casual drinking” night is what it’s referred as.
        <br>&nbsp;
        <br> Now, they need to take a “groupie”. First take, Johnny isn’t even looking. “C’mon bro, do you want to get some likes back or what!?” Retake. Everyone is looking good. Submit.
        <br>
        <br> WEBE sorts the WEBE profiles to display those who also are in the mind-set of casually drinking. Looking at those first will most likely make for a better match. If they had selected a plan/activity as well as a mindset, the app would display those that match both criteria first, creating a more precise match.
        <br>
        <br> Now when they see the other WEBEs, they are able to “like” them. The Thermal-Boys like six groups, five of the six like them back, opening a group chat between them. Within minutes, they nail down a plan to meet up with the “Wonders from Down Under” out in Wicker Park. From there on out, it’s the Thermal-Boy’s and Wonders from Down Under’s responsibility to make it a great night. However, for its purpose, WEBE has just created a chance to make some long lasting memories for two groups of people who were just open minded, energetic, and loving life.</p>
