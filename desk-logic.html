      <p class="prtfolio-p">PlanTheSpace.com is an E-commerce platform that connects office furniture buyers (architects, small tenants) directly with the furniture dealers.&nbsp; It aims to simplify the commercial office furniture-buying process and open that market up.
        <br>
        <br>Desk Logic is a distinct piece of that experience where the user can view, select, and purchase furniture that best meets their needs. My partner and I were tasked with creating a wireframe for this specific flow.</p>

    <p class="prtfolio-p first-paragraph">With little knowledge in the office furniture realm, my partner and I first needed to do extensive research. &nbsp;Some of our research objectives were: &nbsp;
      <br>
      <br> 1) Understand the current office furniture purchasing process and find pain points. 2) Understand the types and styles of furniture typically offered to commercial tenants.
      <br>3) Figure out common patters amongst manufacturers, vendors, and retailers on how they display furniture (both in personal and online).
      <br>
      <br>Our research consisted of:</p>

    <h3 class="processstep">User Test</h3>
    <p class="process-step-p">We tested both wireframes with an experienced furniture dealer and an experienced office manager. &nbsp;
      <br>
      <br> What we discovered was those who are purchasing office furniture desire assistance. Purchasing furniture is a difficult and stressful process involving a good amount of company money. Those is charge of the purchase have many decisions to make and would like to lean on the help of an expert (in this case, PlanTheSpace.com). &nbsp;
      <br>
      <br> With this in mind, we chose a very guided approach to the Desk Logic design.</p>

    <h3 class="processstep">Refine</h3>
    <p class="process-step-p">Designing for a guided experience and ending with a recommendation inherently leads itself to more questions for the user to answer. There are many things to think about when purchasing office furniture, and the questions we ask could be endless.
      <br>
      <br>Most of our time in this second iteration was spend figuring out essential information to extract from the user, and phrasing our questions in a simple fashion to obtain that information. We ended up with four categories deemed as most important in the furniture buying process and based our questions around them:
      <br>
      <br>1) Space
      <br>2) Budget/Time
      <br>3) People/Culture
      <br>4) Vision
      <br>
      <br>The questions were asked in the “Programming” section of our Desk Logic Flow.</p>

            <br>
            <br>3) <strong>Headcount</strong>: This screen’s purpose is to figure out how many people need to be accounted for in terms of chairs, desks, tables, etc.
            <br>
            <br>4) <strong>Mix of Spaces</strong>: This screen’s purpose is to figure out what type of workstations are desired (open or private) and if there are other spaces that need to be accounted for (Conference rooms, Lounges, Reception area, etc.).
            <br>
            <br>5) <strong>Filling Those Spaces</strong>: This screen’s purpose is to figure out any customization that may be desired for these workstations (standing desks, chair type, furniture on wheels, etc.)</p>

    <p class="process-step-p">We tested wireframe with small business owners and some fellow designers. The good news was that the “Programming” section tested very well. Some of our testers even said “wow, I never would have thought about this. That’s super helpful!”
      <br>
      <br>The constructive criticism we received was based on the “Recommendation” and “Adjust” screens. The testers want to see the price more readily available along with easier ability to adjust the order. They also wanted to see some sort of checklist to tie everything together.&nbsp;
      <br>
