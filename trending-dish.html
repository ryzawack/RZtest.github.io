      <p class="prtfolio-p">Trending Dish is a mobile app that helps users find and share dishes. Users can follow their friends, chefs, athletes, celebrities, or their favorite food network host(s) and see what dishes they are currently dabbling in. They can also post dishes they ate themselves.
        <br>
        <br>The app was in its beta stage. As a developer first, the client was apprehensive about his design. He wanted my teammate and I to evaluate and redesign what he had already created.</p>

      <p class="prtfolio-p first-paragraph">The first step in our process was to get the know the app itself. We started off doing our own <em>heuristic evaluation</em> then proceeded to <em>user interviews</em> and <em>user testing</em> to uncover any pain points.</p>

        <br>
        <br>We interviewed current users of the app to figure out how they use the app, what their favorite features are, and what they think could use improvement. In addition, we did specific task testing on brand new users to get a feel for how they interact with Trending Dish.</p>

        <br>
        <br>We plotted our findings on flow chart to see which screens presented the most pain points.</p><img class="flow-image" src="images/The-TD-FLow.gif">

      <p class="prtfolio-p first-paragraph">The first thing we did was address the <em class="emphasized-text">simplicity</em> aspect of our findings. To do so, we combined the “Trending Screen” and “Find” screen into one. We also removed the “Dish Play” screen.
        <br>
        <br>By doing so we created a much more compact app structure, seen in the app maps below:</p>
      <p class="prtfolio-p"><strong class="projectstep">App Maps</strong>
      </p><img class="appmap-image" src="images/Both-Screens.jpg">
      <p class="prtfolio-p">To address the <em class="emphasized-text">efficiency</em> and&nbsp;<em class="emphasized-text">validation</em> aspects of our findings, we next focused on the wireframes for the “Home” screen and the entire “Add Dish” flow as those were the two areas were many of our key findings occurred.</p>
      <h3 class="processstep">Home Screen</h3>
      <div class="w-row home-screen-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <div class="home-screen-header">Before</div><img class="trending-dish-image trending" src="images/OriginalScreens-01.jpg" height="480"><img class="trending-dish-image find" src="images/OriginalScreens-02.jpg" height="480">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="home-screen-p"><em class="emphasized-text uppercase">Search</em> on Trending Dish is a powerful feature. In the beta version, it was tucked away in the “Find” screen. We wanted to place it in the nav bar so that it’s accessible at all times.
        <br>
        <br>A <em class="emphasized-text uppercase">Menu</em> button was created to house preferences and settings.
        <br>
        <br><em class="emphasized-text uppercase">Sort</em> options was a new feature we added because of the combination of the “Trending” and “Find” screens. This allows the user to sort the dishes presented in a different order based off their preference.</p>
      <p class="home-screen-p note"><strong>Note</strong>: We conducted a survey to create the best default sort option. The survey asked participants to rank six deciding factors that are most beneficial when deciding on where to go eat
        <br>
        <br>1) Highest Rated
        <br>2) Most Reviews (“Trending”)
        <br>3) Nearest
        <br>4) What your friends most recently ate (“Live Feed”)
        <br>5) Something Suggested (“For You”)
        <br>6) Price
        <br>
        <br>We ended having 31 participants and there was no clear winner as to which sort option should be our default option. Therefore, we left “Live Feed” as the default and kept the “Trending”, “Recommended”, and “Nearby” sort options the same as what was in the beta version.</p>
      <p class="home-screen-p">The <em class="emphasized-text uppercase">Tool Bar</em> on the bottom now only has three buttons as opposed to four. We moved the “Add Dish” to be front and center of the tool bar given it is the main purpose of Trending Dish.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w-container wide-container dish-card">
      <h3>Home Screen</h3>
      <h3 class="processstep dish-card">(Dish CarD)</h3>
      <p class="home-screen-p">The “Dish Card” is where the input from the user is captured when adding a dish to Trending Dish. It is also a centralized spot for all the other information about that specific dish (restaurant details, user details, reviews). The Dish Card makes Trending Dish, Trending Dish.
        <br>
        <br>After user testing, we found some areas on the beta’s version of the&nbsp;“Dish Card” that needed improvement:<strong><br></strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="dish-card-note">
        <li class="dish-card-note-li">Users had to go to an additional “More” screen to access restaurant details, additional dish details, and to save.</li>
        <li class="dish-card-note-li">Users wanted a way to validate a review (agree/disagree, like/dislike, comment).</li>
        <li class="dish-card-note-li">Users were confused when the stars did not match the “Rating” numerical value (which is actually all the dish’s ratings averaged).</li>
        <li class="dish-card-note-li">Users wanted to see&nbsp;a pricing index of some sort.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="w-row dish-card-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">

      </div>
      <p class="prtfolio-p first-paragraph"><em class="emphasized-text">Efficiency</em> <strong>within the Layout</strong>
        <br>&nbsp;
        <br>1) We wanted the users to have maximum flexibility with this new dish card, allowing them to access everything Trending Dish has to offer from one Dish Card.&nbsp;However, this could compromise simplistic design, therefore:</p>
      <p class="home-screen-p note dc"><strong class="projectstep">A/B Testing.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>We had four different iterations of our new dish card. Ultimately, this screen tested the best aesthetically and for understandability.</p>
      <p class="home-screen-p">2) We gave clickable items a blue color for better affordance.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>3) Lastly, we incorporated a double-click-to-save feature on the dish’s picture.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br><em class="emphasized-text">Validating</em> <strong>Features</strong>
        <br>&nbsp;
        <br>Rating: We stacked the user rating and average rating to easily compare the two. Also, the average rating numerical value was formed into stars for less confusion.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>Reviews: We created a review screen to easily access other reviews.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>Saves: As another way to validate a post, we added a save counter. This acts similar to likes on an Instagram post.</p>

      <p class="home-screen-p">“Add Dish” is the main purpose of Trending Dish, so we needed to make sure the user flow is seamless.
        <br>
        <br>However, during our user testing we found that adding multiple dishes at once and making input changes were common pain points.
        <br>
        <br>To help with this issue we:</p>
